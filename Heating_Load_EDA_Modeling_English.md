🧠 Heating  & Cooling Load Estimation: Modeling Strategy Driven by EDA  

UCI Energy Efficiency Dataset | Feature Selection + Linear vs. Random Forest

🔍 Summary  

This project aims to predict a building’s heating (Y1) and cooling (Y2) load using eight architectural parameters from the UCI Energy Efficiency dataset.

Scope:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Correlation + VIF analysis for multicollinearity

- Distribution tests for target variables

- Two modeling approaches: Linear Regression ↔ Random Forest

Outcome:  

A reduced feature set with only 5 variables. The simplified Random Forest model reduced MAE by 62% compared to the linear baseline.

🏗️ Why This Problem Matters  

Heating and cooling energy demand is a critical cost and sustainability factor in building design. For early-stage architectural planning, predicting energy loads from design inputs (compactness, glazing area, orientation, etc.) enables smarter decisions on both carbon and financial fronts.

Target: Estimate Y1 (Heating Load) and Y2 (Cooling Load) [kWh] with ±5 kWh error during the design phase.

📊 Dataset Overview  

✅ Clean dataset with 768 samples × 8 features. No missing values. Ready for modeling.

🔬 Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial Checks  

- No missing values.  

- No outliers detected using the IQR method.  

- Distributions are mostly smooth and consistent.

Correlation Analysis  

Key observations:

- Strong correlations: Relative Compactness ↔ Surface Area ↔ Overall Height (r > 0.9)

- Target variables Y1 and Y2 are highly correlated (r = 0.98)

- Orientation and glazing features show low correlation → likely to provide independent signal

Why this matters:  

Correlation ≠ multicollinearity. High correlation is a red flag, but we need VIF to confirm redundancy.

Multicollinearity: VIF Check  

Even though Wall Area and Surface Area have weak pairwise correlation (r ≈ 0.2), their VIFs indicate extreme multicollinearity. This proves correlation alone is not sufficient to assess variable redundancy.

Target Distribution Analysis  

- Y1 (Heating Load): Right-skewed

- Y2 (Cooling Load): Even more skewed with visible outliers

Insight:  

Linear models assume normality in the target distribution. These plots reveal that assumption is violated → we consider more flexible models.

🤖 Model Strategy: Linear or Random Forest?  

Assumption vs. Reality vs. Response

Perspective | Observation

----------- | -----------

Assumption | Linear regression works best with normal target distributions and low multicollinearity

Reality | Target distributions are skewed + multicollinearity exists (VIF > 10)

Response | Start with interpretable Linear Regression. Validate with Random Forest (non-parametric). Use SHAP to maintain transparency.

Model Benchmark  

Model | Rationale | Metric Focus

------|-----------|--------------

Linear Regression | Fast & interpretable | MAE / Adjusted R²

Random Forest | No distribution assumptions | MAE / SHAP

Evaluation:  

5-fold nested cross-validation → Inner loop for tuning, outer loop for generalization.

📉 Risk & Assumption Log  

- Simulated Data: Requires calibration before deployment  

- Missing variables: Internal heat gain not modeled  

- Small sample (n=768): May overfit in nonparametric models  

- Energy pricing: Assumed fixed; elasticity not modeled

Despite limitations, this model offers a strong balance between transparency and predictive performance — a viable early-stage decision tool.
